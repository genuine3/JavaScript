<h1>In this exercise, you are going to create a for loop from scratch. 
	We have already created the counter variable i for you, and a text variable for output. 
	Your task is to create a FOR LOOP that output the numbers 1 3 5 7 9 with line breaks between each number. 
	WARNING: Remember to increase the variable used in the 
	condition to avoid infinite loops (will crash your browser).
